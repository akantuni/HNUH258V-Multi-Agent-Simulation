# Multi-Agent Simulation

## Overview
This Python-based simulation features multiple agents (circles) moving on the screen, showcasing various behaviors and interactions. It's built using the `pygame` library and serves as an example of a multi-agent system.

## Demo
Work in progress. Please download `Multi-Agent Simulation Demo.mov` from the `demo` folder to view the demo.

## Installation
Ensure Python is installed on your system, along with the `pygame` library. Install `pygame` with this command:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Simulation Setup
The simulation consists of three main components:
- `main.py`: The main loop handling the simulation's core logic.
- `agent.py`: Manages the behavior of the agents (circles) in the simulation.
- `options.py`: Contains configurable options such as agent count, behavior parameters, etc.

To run the simulation, execute `main.py`:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Simulation Details
- The simulation runs fullscreen, displaying the movement and interaction of agents.
- Parameters such as agent count, behavior, and other dynamics can be adjusted in `options.py`.

## Features
- Fullscreen display with smooth agent animations.
- Customizable simulation parameters.
- Dynamic agent behavior illustrating complex interactions.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Pygame

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Please follow the standard fork-and-pull request workflow for contributions.



Enjoy the simulation!
