# Multi-Agent Simulation

## Overview

This Python-based simulation features multiple agents (circles) moving on the screen, showcasing various behaviors and interactions. It's built using the `pygame` library and serves as an example of a multi-agent system.

## Demo

Work in progress. Please download `Multi-Agent Simulation Demo.mov` from the `demo` folder to view the demo.

## Installation

Ensure Python is installed on your system, along with the `pygame` library. Install `pygame` with this command:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Simulation Setup

The simulation consists of three main components:

- `main.py`: The main loop handling the simulation's core logic.
- `agent.py`: Manages the behavior of the agents (circles) in the simulation.
- `options.py`: Contains configurable options such as agent count, behavior parameters, etc.

To run the simulation, execute `main.py`:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Simulation Details

- The simulation runs fullscreen, displaying the movement and interaction of agents.
- Parameters such as agent count, behavior, and other dynamics can be adjusted in `options.py`.

## Features

- Fullscreen display with smooth agent animations.
- Customizable simulation parameters.
- Dynamic agent behavior illustrating complex interactions.

## Dependencies

- Python
- Pygame

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please follow the standard fork-and-pull request workflow for contributions.

Enjoy the simulation!
